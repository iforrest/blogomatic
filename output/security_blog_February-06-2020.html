Howdy, folks!
A new month, so a new list of security picks! <strong>Splunk</strong> security nerds (employees and customers) like to make things. They like to make LOTS of things. But sometimes... they get lost! So as we promised in <a href="https://www.splunk.com/blog/2018/01/24/staff-picks-for-splunk-security-reading-january-2018.html">early 2018</a>, we are bringing you some golden security nuggets you might not have seen before. These monthly postings will feature the favorite security-centric presentations, white papers and customer case studies from various peeps in the Splunk (or not)  security world that WE think everyone should read. If you would like to read other months, please take a peek <a href="https://www.splunk.com/blog/search.html?query=%22staff%2Bpicks%22">here</a>! I hope you enjoy.

                <p style="text-align: center;">This month had lots to choose from, but I wanted to highlight Talos's fascinating blog post on a campaign they are calling "Sea Turtle" which is built around DNS Hijacking. This campaign has been going on for over two years, and while it is predominantly focused in the Middle East and North Africa, some of the techniques used are new and unique; like anything else, success will breed greater adoption of these successful techniques in other adversary's toolkits. For example, they employed certificate impersonation as part of their man in the middle attack using certificates issued from other providers, making the MitM attack less likely to be detected. They also steal the organization's legitimate SSL certificates and use them on adversary controlled servers. Talos provides IOCs as well as CVEs for the vulnerabilities that provide initial access, so there are some excellent takeaways in the post beyond the information on Sea Turtle. It is crucial to maintain control of your DNS servers, and this article highlights new ways adversaries are trying to wrest away that control to gain access deeper into the organizations.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">As someone who has been advocating the detection of malicious activities via DNS for many years, I was dismayed when I found out about malicious use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH). This is a great technical primer for blue teamers to learn the ins and outs of DoH and how red teamers/adversaries can use it to bypass just about every single defense we have. I spent some time after this paper trying to whiteboard how to detect DoH consistently... and I'm not gonna lie, it's going to be hard. If you have ideas, hit me up on Twitter!</p>

Not only did it introduce us to his love for all things acquatic/submarines, it also was our first glimpse of some truly convincing digital effects technology; something that would be perfected in Terminator 2 (not underrated). Also, that <a href="https://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/node_image/public/img/post/2017/12/20/trim.jpg?itok=LoUDC2yp">pink, breathable liquid</a> was the coolest thing ever - I so want that to exist.
