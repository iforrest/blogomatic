  Howdy, folks!
  A new month, so a new list of [staff pics for Splunk security reading](https://www.splunk.com/blog/search.html?query=%22staff%2Bpicks%2Bfor%2Bsplunk%2Bsecurity%22) Splunk security nerds (employees and [customers](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/customers.html)like to make things. They like to make LOTS of things. But sometimes... they get lost! So as we promised in [early 2018](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2018/01/24/staff-picks-for-splunk-security-reading-january-2018.html), we're bringing you some golden security nuggets you might not have seen before. These monthly postings will feature the favorite security-centric presentations, white papers and customer case studies from various peeps in the Splunk (or not) security world that WE think everyone should read. If you would like to read other months,&nbsp;please take a peek at previous posts in the ["Staff Picks"](https://www.splunk.com/blog/search.html?query=%22staff%2Bpicks%22) series! I hope you enjoy.
